# Credit Card Fraud Analytics

## Overview

This project focuses on the analysis and detection of credit card fraud using machine learning models. The primary aim is to identify anomalous transactions within credit card data through extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the implementation of isolation forest and LOF (Local Outlier Factor) models.

## Project Scope

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Investigated credit card transaction data to understand patterns and distributions.
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify potential features associated with fraudulent activities.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handled missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
   - Prepared the data for model training and evaluation.

3. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Implemented Isolation Forest and LOF models for the detection of anomalous transactions.
   - Explored hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance.

4. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Engaged in feature engineering to improve the models' ability to detect fraudulent patterns.

## Key Findings

1. **Anomaly Detection:**
   - Successfully identified and isolated potentially fraudulent transactions using machine learning models.

2. **Model Performance:**
   - Evaluated the performance of the Isolation Forest and LOF models using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage

1. **Requirements:**
   - Python 3.9.10
   - NumPy
   - scikit-learn (sklearn)
   - Pandas
   - Matplotlib
   - Seaborn
